It is established at some point in time and it may be considered valid only in some Location and/or for some interval in time. An agreement may be defined at varying levels of detail, this is supported with the introduction of the ComplexAgreement and AtomicAgreement class. A complex agreement may be decomposed into sub-agreements, whereas an atomic agreement cannot. Similar to the approach taken for the representation of activities, a complex agreement may be decomposed into disjunctive or conjunctive sub-agreements. This allows for the representation of both types of agreement composition. At their most simple level, the AtomicAgreement describes a commitment to some activity; this is captured with the commitsToActivity property.  Finally, agreements involve some specification of rights or commitments of the involved parties. This is represented as a relationship between the involved Agent and a particular activity. The precise nature of the relationship indicates the type of agreement. The possible relationships are defined according to the elements of the primary rules of the Hohfeldian analytical system, (and their opposites): claim and privilege.</p> <p>This ontology consists of the following patterns:</p> <p>The ontology also contains the following classes that are not assigned to any pattern:</p> <ul> <li>Agent (Agreement)</li> <li>Agreement (Agreement)</li> <li>Agreement Ontology Thing (Agreement)</li> <li>Atomic Agreement</li> <li>Complex Agreement</li> <li>Conjunctive Agreement (Agreement)</li> <li>Disjunctive Agreement (Agreement)</li> </ul> <p>The formal definition of these patterns is available in OWL Syntax.</p>"},{"location":"#city-units-of-measure","title":"City Units of Measure","text":"<p>Annotation property introduced for organization purposes, to identify annotation properties defined in the Units of Measure Ontology.</p> <p>This ontology consists of the following patterns:</p> <p>The ontology also contains the following classes that are not assigned to any pattern:</p> <ul> <li>acceleration</li> <li>acceleration unit</li> <li>amount of money</li> <li>area</li> <li>area unit</li> <li>Capacity (CityUnits)</li> <li>Capacity Rate (CityUnits)</li> <li>Capacity Size (CityUnits)</li> <li>Cardinality Measure (CityUnits)</li> <li>Cardinality Unit Per Time (CityUnits)</li> <li>City Units Thing (CityUnits)</li> <li>duration</li> <li>function</li> <li>Geo_Position_unit (CityUnits)</li> <li>length</li> <li>length unit</li> <li>mass</li> <li>mass unit</li> <li>Monetary Value (CityUnits)</li> <li>ratio</li> <li>speed</li> <li>speed unit</li> <li>time unit</li> <li>Value Of Money (CityUnits)</li> <li>volume</li> <li>volume unit</li> </ul> <p>The formal definition of these patterns is available in OWL Syntax.</p>"},{"location":"#generic-properties","title":"Generic Properties","text":"<p>Ontology to define generic properties used throughout the ISO 5087 series.</p> <p>This ontology consists of the following patterns:</p> <p>The formal definition of these patterns is available in OWL Syntax.</p>"},{"location":"#icity-change-ontology","title":"iCity Change Ontology","text":"<p>Many of the concepts identified in the urban system ontologies are subject to change. For example, a Vehicle will have one location at one time, and another location at a later time; it may have only one passenger at one time, and four passengers at a later time. Similarly, many attributes of Persons, Households, and even Transportation Networks are subject to change. An approach to representing changing properties, or fluents, that leverages the 4-dimensionalist perspective was proposed by (Welty, Fikes, and Makarios, 2006). We adopt a similar approach, based on a re-interpretation by Krieger (2008) requiring the division of classes that are subject to change into two parts: invariant and variant parts of the concept; we refer to these as TimeVaryingConcept and Manifestation classes, respectively. By distinguishing between these class types and recognizing the properties that are (and aren't) subject to change, the ontology supports the capture of both the static and dynamic aspects of a particular entity. </p> <p>This ontology consists of the following patterns:</p> <p>The ontology also contains the following classes that are not assigned to any pattern:</p> <ul> <li>Change Ontology Thing (Change)</li> <li>First Manifestation (Change)</li> <li>Manifestation (Change)</li> </ul> <p>The formal definition of these patterns is available in OWL Syntax.</p>"},{"location":"#icity-resource-ontology","title":"iCity Resource Ontology","text":"<p>This ontology provides a generic representation of resources that contain core properties generic across all transportation uses. We take the view presented in the TOVE model (Fadel, Fox, and Gruninger, 1994) that \"...being a resource is not an innate property of an object but a property that is derived from the role the object plays with respect to an activity\". The definition of  a resource is dependent on its participation in an activity occurrence, so the Resource ontology is in fact an extension of the Activity ontology. In this sense, Resources are a class of manifestations, so that rather than have a specialized Resource-perdurant (PD) class, a Resource is a manifestation of some other perdurant class in the ontology. For example, an instance of a Vehicle that is a manifestation of some VehiclePD may also be an instance of a resource, whereas some other instance of a Vehicle that is some later manifestation of the same VehiclePD may not be a Resource, or it may be a different Resource. </p> <p>This ontology consists of the following patterns:</p> <p>The ontology also contains the following classes that are not assigned to any pattern:</p> <ul> <li>Consume State (Resource)</li> <li>Divisible Resource (Resource)</li> <li>Non Divisible Resource (Resource)</li> <li>Planned Allocation (Resource)</li> <li>Produce State (Resource)</li> <li>Release State (Resource)</li> <li>Resource (Resource)</li> <li>Resource Ontology Thing (Resource)</li> <li>Terminal Resource State (Resource)</li> <li>Use State (Resource)</li> </ul> <p>The formal definition of these patterns is available in OWL Syntax.</p>"},{"location":"#iso-5087-1-provenance-pattern","title":"ISO 5087-1 Provenance Pattern","text":"<p>Ontology to capture concepts related to provenance.</p> <p>This ontology consists of the following patterns:</p> <p>The ontology also contains the following classes that are not assigned to any pattern:</p> <ul> <li>Activity (Prov)</li> <li>Agent (Prov)</li> <li>Prov Ontology Thing (Prov)</li> </ul> <p>The formal definition of these patterns is available in OWL Syntax.</p>"},{"location":"#mereology-ontology","title":"Mereology Ontology","text":"<p>Ontology to capture concepts related to parthood.
